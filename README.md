# Memo-GPT

A complete Software As a Service application that helps users take notes during meetings, providing summaries of recorded or uploaded audio, chat about the meeting or audio with a GPT-based AI and query the AI for specific answers within the audio without the necessity of listening to the entire audio.




#### This SAS application effectively eliminates the need for manual note-taking during meetings, lectures, and conversations, as it autonomously does it for you with intelligence.

## Database Models

The main database models are:

- **User** - Stores user account info
- **Audio** - Stores audio files and transcripts  
- **Summary** - Transcript summaries generated by LLama
- **History** - Conversation history with the LLama bot
  
Relationships are defined between user, audio, summaries and history.

## API Endpoints

The API endpoints are organized by HTTP method below:

### GET Endpoints

- GET /verify/{token} - Verify email 

- GET /audio - Stream audio

- GET /webhook_verification - Verify webhook

- GET /audio/data - Get audio data

- GET /all_chats - Get all chats

### POST Endpoints  

- POST /signup - Create user

## Gradio UI

This project incorporates a Gradio user interface for demonstration and testing purposes. The objective is to facilitate comprehension of the project for non-technical individuals, without the necessity of interacting with the API endpoints.


## Premium Accounts

To access transcripts over 5 minutes users need a premium account. This is handled via:

- Premium pricing plans defined in `users_schema.py`
- `paystack.py` handles payments with Paystack API
- `premium_services.py` checks if user account is premium
- Duration stored in User model to track when premium expires
