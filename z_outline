-----Test--------: Ah, I see. Based on the transcript, it seems you might be referring to Karl Jaspers, a profoundly influential German philosopher known for his work in existential 
philosophy and pioneering in the field of philosophy of mind. (9700)

Jaspers had a comprehensive impact on modern theology, psychiatric philosophy, and literature. (19892)

Would this be the philosopher you were thinking of? (25842)

If you're referring to Carl Jones, there are several notable individuals with that name, including people in areas such as media producing and education, among others. (28364)       

Do keep in mind that philosophical thought is a vast field with countless contributors across centuries and cultures. (38076)

If the mentioned individuals don't match your search, could you provide any additional information to help narrow down the possibilities? (44962)

It's an engaging puzzle, and I'm all set to help further smile. (52138)

Context: Teplizumab traces its roots to a New Jersey drug company called Ortho Pharmaceutical. There, scientists generated an early version of the antibody, dubbed OKT3. Originally sourced from mice, the molecule was able to bind to the surface of T cells and limit their cell-killing potential. In 1986, it was approved to help prevent organ rejection after kidney transplants, making it the first therapeutic antibody allowed for human use.

Question: What was OKT3 originally sourced from?
